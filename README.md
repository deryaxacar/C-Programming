  This file implements the binary search algorithm to find a specific element in an array. Binary search is an efficient method for searching in a sorted array. 🔍

- **`calculate_grade.c`**:  
  This file calculates a letter grade based on student scores. It demonstrates how to map numeric scores to letter grades. 🎓

- **`simple-calculator.c`**:  
  This file is a simple calculator program that performs the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 🧮

- **`sum-of-numbers.c`**:  
  This file takes a list of numbers from the user and calculates their sum using loops and arithmetic operations. ➕🔢

- **`the-multiplication-table.c`**:  
  This file generates a multiplication table for a given number. It helps in learning multiplication and how to build tabular outputs. ✖️📊

- **`id_number_check.c`**:  
  This file checks the validity of a given ID number. It demonstrates data validation and basic verification logic. 🆔✅

## Usage

To run each program, you need to compile the file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`). For example:

1. Compile the program:
    ```sh
    gcc binary_search.c -o binary_search
    ```

2. Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    ./binary_search
    ```

Repeat the same steps for other files by replacing the file name accordingly.
